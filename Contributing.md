If you are contributing to this project as an individual, independent of any employer or third-party institutional work (i.e., the contribution is not within the scope of your employment or any other entity), please sign the Individual CLA. If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, company, government agency, or other legal entity, or if the contribution constitutes work made for hire or falls within your job duties, you must sign the Corporate CLA, which must be executed by an authorized representative of your entity with an official seal (or equivalent electronic authentication). Once your CLA is on file, you may submit pull requests without any additional action. If your CLA is not yet signed, the project maintainers may ask you to sign it before reviewing your contribution.

When creating a pull request, please include a statement in the pull request description confirming that you have read and agreed to the CLA (e.g., "I have signed the CLA and agree to its terms."). The project may also use an automated bot to verify CLA status.

## Testing Requirements

When adding new features or fixing bugs, please add corresponding tests where feasible. At minimum, run the tests related to the files or functionality you changed. If a test cannot be added or cannot be run locally, explain the reason in the Pull Request description.

## Pull Request Guidelines

A good Pull Request should include:

- A concise summary of the change
- The motivation or issue being addressed
- The testing performed and the results
- Any known limitations, risks, or follow-up work
- Links to related issues, design notes, or discussions, if applicable

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed design and expected impact.

## Pull Request Review

- Pull Requests require maintainer review before merging.
- Reviewers may request changes for correctness, maintainability, compatibility, documentation, tests, or security.
- Pull Requests with no activity for an extended period may be closed. They can be reopened when work resumes.
